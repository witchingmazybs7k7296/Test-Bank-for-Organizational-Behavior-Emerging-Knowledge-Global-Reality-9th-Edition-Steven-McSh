  * Organizational Behavior, 9e by McShane/Von Glinow helps everyone make sense of OB and provides the conceptual tools to work more effectively in the workplace. It emphasizes emerging OB knowledge with globally focused, real-world examples and evidence-based literature. This edition explains how work-life integration is becoming an essential employee practice in the workplace; how social networks generate power and shape communication patterns; how emotions influence employee motivation, attitudes, and decisions; how self-concept is a significant determinant of individual behavior, team cohesion, and leadership; and how adopting a global mindset has become an important employee characteristic in this increasingly interconnected world. This book presents the reality that organizational behavior is not just for managers; it is relevant and valuable to anyone who works in and around organizations.
 
* The McShane and Von Glinow product is acclaimed for:
* • Readability, presentation of current knowledge
* • Linking OB concepts and theories with reality
* • Strong International / Global orientation
* • Contemporary Theory Foundation (without the jargon)
* • Active Learning and Critical Thinking Support
* • Textbook's philosophy OB knowledge is for everyone, not just traditional managers
